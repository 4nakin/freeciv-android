It includes Freeciv 2.3.1

If you don't need to change source code and don't need latest version simply download APK from http://civ.zielm.com

== INSTALLATION ==
Building Freeciv for Android is probably only possible on Linux/Unix. On Ubuntu/Debian you need:
   sudo apt-get install python-lzma python-tk python-pygame zlib1g-dev python2.7-dev libpython2.7 cython gcc

You need to download and install SDL 2.0, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf
As you probably won't find them in your disto, use http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL-2.0.tar.gz, http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image/ and http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf/

Build and run on desktop (for debugging):
   make run

Building for Android doesn't work yet in this branch.
