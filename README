It includes Freeciv 2.3.1

If you don't need to change source code and don't need latest version simply download APK from http://civ.zielm.com

== INSTALLATION ==
Building Freeciv for Android is probably only possible on Linux/Unix. On Ubuntu/Debian you need:
   sudo apt-get install python-lzma python-tk python-pygame zlib1g-dev python2.7-dev libpython2.7 cython gcc

You also need to download and install SDL 1.3 (1.3, not anything else, 2.0 MAY work).
You probably won't find it in your disto, so use http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL-1.3.tar.gz

Build and run on desktop (for debugging):
   make run

Building for Android doesn't work yet in this branch.
